Use the [in-browser GraphiQL app](https://docs.twenty.com/graphql/) to browse, query, and mutate the introspection query. 

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that enables declarative data fetching that allows a client to specify the exact data it needs from the API.

Instead of exposing various endpoints that return fixed data structures, GraphQL exposes only a single endpoint that precisely returns the data that the client asked for. This makes GraphQL more flexible and efficient than other kinds of APIs, like REST APIs. 

You can learn more about GraphQL by going through this [Introduction](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/).

## About GraphQL Introspection

GraphQL query language is strongly typed, which makes it possible for you to query and understand the underlying schema. 

With the Introspection feature, you can query the schema and discover the queries (to request data), mutations (to update data), types, and fields available in a particular GraphQL API.

## Try the GraphQL Playground
You can use the browser-based, interactive [GraphQL playground](https://docs.twenty.com/graphql/) to run mutations and queries to discover valid fields and where you can use them.  You can learn even more on the [GraphiQL Readme](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql)

### Authentication
You can authenticate yourself in the [GraphQL playground](https://docs.twenty.com/graphql/) using the Headers Section with this json:

```
{
  "email": "$your-email",
  "Authorization": "Bearer $API-Token"
}
```

### GraphiQL Getting Started and first Queries
In the [GraphQL playground](https://docs.twenty.com/graphql/) a good first step is to list all your People.  You can do this using the following Query:

``` 

```

You can update your query with the different objects available to you.
